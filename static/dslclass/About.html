<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Hi there! I'm Scott Stanchfield. Welcome to 605.606, Programming with Domain-Specific Languages!</p>
<p>I'd like to ask you all to do the following:</p>
<p><strong>ACTION</strong>: Please be sure that your email and phone numbers are correct in JHED and SIS. I'll use these to send announcements. If you saw this announcement in your email you should be ok.</p>
<p>If you have questions during the course, please:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FIRST: search using Google or StackOverflow for ideas. You can often find a response faster than I will see your question and respond</li>
  <li>SECOND: check the forum and see if the question has been asked</li>

<p>Here's to a great term!</p>
<p>Scott</p><h1>Course Overview</h1><p>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are little languages you write that look and feel like a spoken way to specify data or write code. You can use them for input and output, incorporating the jargon and nomenclature of your subject-matter experts (SMEs), as well as inside your own code to make it more expressive and fluent, and often simpler. You can use them as part of your build process to generate hundreds of classes full of otherwise tedious and error-prone boilerplate code from a small specification in a consistent manner. In this course, weâ€™ll design and implement several types of DSLs. Weâ€™ll write code to edit and import data, allowing SMEs more natural-feeling access to your software. Weâ€™ll create APIs in multiple programming languages to make it easier and more secure for others to use your libraries. Weâ€™ll generate code to improve productivity and reliability in your own software.</p>
<p>Examples and assignments in this class will be done in several programming languages. We assume a high comfort level with Java and the ability to adapt to new languages quickly.</p><h1>Instructor Biography</h1><h1>Scott Stanchfield</h1>
<p><img src="Static/images/Scott.png" alt="Scott Stanchfield" /></p>
<p>By day, Scott works at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), pretending to be a Rocket Scientist. They usually tell him to go play with some blocks in the corner. Those blocks often turn into software that saves the world by helping track the spread of diseases, clean up chemical spills and creating <span style='color:red;background:black'>[ REDACTED BY NSA ]</span> that can <span style='color:red;background:black'>[ REDACTED BY NSA ]</span> for <span style='color:red;background:black'>[ REDACTED BY NSA ]</span>.</p>
<p>By night, Scott can be found teaching Design Patterns and Android Mobile Application Development for the JHU Whiting School. But that doesn't stop him from acting and directing with the APL Drama Club, Swing dancing, singing Karaoke and attending musicals whenever they stop in Baltimore or DC.</p>
<p>Scott has been teaching in various forms since High School, and at the Whiting School for over ten years.</p>
<p>And he keeps coming back for more...</p>
