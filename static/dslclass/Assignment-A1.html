<div class="col1">
<p>In this assignment, you'll create a simple fluent API to create a limited subset of Java Swing GUIs.</p>

<p>Grab the starter code from <a href="Static/Assignment1.kt">Assignment1.kt</a> </p>
<p>Create an implementation of the missing GuiBuilder class. Do not use Progressive Interfaces or Child Builders for your implementation. </p>
<p>Note that your implementation will need to do some error checking to validate the order of function calls. This will be runtime validation; you can throw exceptions if the GUI is in error. Some cases to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>north(), south(), east(), west() and center() can only be called if the current layout is a BorderLayout. (The top-level is automatically a BorderLayout)</li>
  <li>After calling north(), south(), east(), west() and center(), a component (button(), grid(), flow() or border()) must be the next function called</li>
  <li>grid(), flow() and border() must be ended with an end() call</li>
  <li>No builder functions can be called after show()</li>
</ul>
<p>After implementing the GuiBuilder, test it with 3-4 GUIs that you define. These GUIs should be submitted with your code.</p>
<p>After testing, answer the following questions and submit with your code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compared to the "raw" approach at the top of the app</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you think your implementation affects performance?</li>
      <li>How do you think your implementation affects maintainability (consider the builder and use of the builder separately)?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Describe a case where the GUI would be ambiguous if we did not have the end() call</p></li>
  <li>Could this builder language be implemented using Progressive Interfaces or Child Builders? If no, why not?
    <ul>
      <li>As-is?</li>
      <li>With minor changes?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we added new components (like a TextField), how would the following be impacted? (For this question, assume all could be used to implement this language)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your implementation</li>
      <li>A Progressive Interface implementation</li>
      <li>A Child Builder implementation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>From the point of view of the user of your builder, how would a Progressive Interface or Child Builder make his work easier or more difficult?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Submitting Your Assignment</h2>
		
<p>To submit your assignment (do this outside IntelliJ/Android Studio):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Close the project in IntelliJ/Android Studio (and/or quit IntelliJ/Android Studio)</li>
	<li>Find the directory for your project</li>
	<li>Delete the build and app/build directories from the project folder</li>
	<li>Zip the project directory. Be sure to get all files and subdirectories, including those that start with '.'.  Be sure to name the zip file lastname.firstname.hw1</li>
	<li>Go to the Blackboard course website</li>
	<li>Click on the <b><i>Assignment Submission</i></b> link on the left navigation bar</li>
	<li>Click on the <b><i>Assignment A1</i></b> link</li>
	<li>Attach your submission and enter any notes</li>
	<li>Be sure to <b><i>submit</i></b> your assignment, not just save it!</li>
</ol>
