<h1>Instructor Contact</h1>
<p><strong>Scott Stanchfield</strong> Home/Cell: 301.609.0545 E-mail: scott@javadude.com</p>
<p>I prefer that students contact me via email rather than by phone. Please be sure to include the course number in the subject line. I will make every effort to respond to your inquiry within 48 hours or earlier. If an issue is urgent, please add "urgent" within the subject line of the email and I will respond as soon as is practical.</p>
<p><em>Please attempt to find answers on your own before emailing or calling me. I often get a question from a student followed 10 minutes later with "never mind; I figured it out". I'm happy to help, but much of the time your question can be answered much more quickly via Google or StackOverflow.</em></p>
<p>If you need to call, please do so only between the hours of 9a-9p. My cell phone above is my only phone.</p>
<h1>Office Hours (Online Sections Only)</h1>
<p>If this is an online section, Office Hours will be held each Sunday from 1pm-2pm Eastern (starting June 10).</p>
<p>Please use the "Office Hours" link from the Blackboard site to enter Adobe Connect. <em>Please be sure to try loading Adobe Connect before an Office Hour session, as it can be stubborn to get to work...</em></p>
<p>(If this is a face-to-face section, please ask questions before, during or after class)</p>
<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are little languages you write that look and feel like a spoken way to specify data or write code. You can use them for input and output, incorporating the jargon and nomenclature of your subject-matter experts (SMEs), as well as inside your own code to make it more expressive and fluent, and often simpler. You can use them as part of your build process to generate hundreds of classes full of otherwise tedious and error-prone boilerplate code from a small specification in a consistent manner. In this course, weâ€™ll design and implement several types of DSLs. Weâ€™ll write code to edit and import data, allowing SMEs more natural-feeling access to your software. Weâ€™ll create APIs in multiple programming languages to make it easier and more secure for others to use your libraries. Weâ€™ll generate code to improve productivity and reliability in your own software.</p>
<p>Examples and assignments in this class will be done in several programming languages. We assume a high comfort level with Java and the ability to adapt to new languages quickly.</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This course relies on a high comfort level with the Java language and basic APIs. You will need to feel very comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Java language, especially</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class and interface inheritance</li>
      <li>Inner classes (including anonymous inner classes)</li>
      <li>Using callbacks/listeners/observer pattern</li>
      <li>Using threads in your application, including synchronizing data access</li>
      <li>Debugging by reading exception stack traces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Writing basic XML files</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Basic data structures in Java (lists, maps)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not comfortable with these concepts, the assignments in this course can be quite difficult to complete. </p>
<h1>Course Goals</h1>
<p>Understand what DSLs are, when to use them, and how to implement the most common types of DSLs</p>
<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Describe the purposes for DSLs</p></li><li><p>Describe the differences between internal and external DSLs.</p></li><li><p>Implement internal and external DSLs using various programming languages and tools.</p></li><li><p>Generate code using data obtained from DSLs.</p></li></ul>
<h1>Course Structure</h1>
<p>The course materials are divided into modules. For online sections, the Modules can be accessed by clicking <em>Course Content</em> on the left menu in Blackboard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Each week contains one or more modules</strong></em>. Please check the Course Outline for a detailed overview of the course layout. </p>
<p>For online sections, each module contains one or more videos, slides and example source code. This content is available for all sections, online or face-to-face, but for face-to-face sections, this material is considered supplementary. The material taught in the face-to-face classroom is considered the material you must use for the course.</p>
<p>In face-to-face sections, I will video record the lectures using Camtasia and post them after the class meeting. </p>

  <li>
  <p>Access to the internet to download tools and access the course web site.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Student Coursework Requirements</h1>
<p>This course is graded solely on your assignment submissions. There are 5 programming assignments. Each is worth 100 points.</p>
<p>All assignments are due according to the dates in the course outline.</p>
<p>Late submissions will be reduced by one letter grade (10 percent) for each <em><strong>DAY</strong></em> (or partial day) late (no exceptions without timely prior coordination with the instructors). See the grading policy for assignment grading details.</p>
<table><tr><td>

<p><b>Expected Conflicts</b>: If you expect any issues with turning in work on time, please see the instructor as soon as you know. If I know 
in advance about business travel and expected high workloads, I can work with you. However, letting me know a day or 
two before an assignment is due is not acceptable (you've had time to work on the assignment prior to the interruption).</p>

<p><b>Technical Problems with Blackboard</b>: If you encounter issues while trying to submit your 
assignment, please immediately send me an email with your submission text and a note stating that BlackBoard is being your best friend. 
If you submit in this manner, I will not count your submission as late.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Each day late results in a one-letter grade (10 percent) drop on the assignment.</p>
<h2>Grade Scale</h2>
<p>All assignments are worth 100 points</p>
<p>Assignments will be graded from 0-100.</p>
<p>NOTE: 95 is the normal "best grade" on an assignment, representing an "A". Do not think of an "A" as "I lost points"; that's the standard grade for a well-done submission. I rarely give A+ as a grade. <em>Again, do not think you have lost points if you do not get A+/100 on an assignment. A/95 is normally the highest grade you'll receive on an assignment.</em></p>
<table>
<thead><th>Letter Grade</th><th>Numeric Score in BlackBoard</th></thead>
<tr><td>A+</td><td>100</td></tr>
<tr><td>A </td><td>95</td></tr>
<tr><td>A-</td><td>92</td></tr>
<tr><td>B+</td><td>88</td></tr>
<tr><td>B </td><td>85</td></tr>
<tr><td>B-</td><td>82</td></tr>
<tr><td>C+</td><td>78</td></tr>
<tr><td>C </td><td>75</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>F </td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Your final grade <em><strong>WILL NOT</strong></em> include +/- designations. A+/A/A- all count as "A" and "4" for GPA purposes (and similar for other letter grades).</p>
<p><strong>Regarding "A+" work</strong>. "A+" is not given for "extra credit". In fact, if you do extra things that are not in the assignment description (without getting an "ok" from the instructor), your grade <em>will</em> be penalized. An "A+" on an assignment means you did all functionality and have code that feels "exemplary". </p>
<p>When grading assignments, I will write comments describing your grade, but I will usually not note specific point-value deductions. I take this approach because far too much time has been spent in the past debating deductions of "1 point" which ended up having no effect on the assignment grade.</p>
<p>If you disagree with a grade you can ask us to review it. Tell us what your concerns are and I'll look at it. Sometimes I may miss something in your code due to the number of assignments I have to grade.</p>
<p>This course often has full enrollment. Due to the large number of students, grading can take a significant amount of time and you may not receive feedback for 1-2 weeks. If I note a problem with a submission but do not return it at least 4 days before the next assignment is due, I will not count the same problem off on the next assignment <em>unless the problem is something that is clearly spelled out in the assignment description or grading policy</em>. For example, if you do not follow the course coding conventions spelled out in this syllabus, your grade will be maxed at A- regardless of when the previous assignment was returned.</p>
<h2>Distribution of Grades</h2>
<p>It is possible (and has happened in past sections of my other courses) for everyone to get an "A" in this course. I will not be applying any sort of curve or other means to artificially distribute grades.</p>
<p>I will be looking closely at your <em>efforts</em> in this class. An "A" grade in this course requires a good deal of effort. Do not expect an "A" if you start programming a few nights before they are due...</p>
<p>Let me repeat that. Do not expect an "A" if you start programming assignments a few nights before they are due... This has often been the reason for B and C grades in the course; students do not allow enough time to ask clarifying questions or do the coding.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be sure to at least look over and understand the assignments at the beginning of the week they are assigned! This will give you time to ask questions.</strong></em></p>
<p>Basically, if you do all the work well and on-time, you will get an "A" for the course. If you do all of the work on-time but are having trouble with the concepts, you'll likely get a "B" for the course. If you're in danger of a lower grade, I will speak with you as soon as it becomes apparent to me.</p>
<h1>Programming Assignments</h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I highly recommend that you store your code in a version control system such as git or subversion. However, if you host your project on a public site like github, you must make the repositories private! (Note that bitbucket provides free private repositories) Any non-private repositories that I find online will automatically set your grade to "F" for sharing code.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be sure to control your source code! Lost code will not be accepted as an excuse for late or missing assignments.</strong></em></p>
<p>Students may use computers at home, work, or at Johns Hopkins for the programming assignments.</p>
<p>Note that the easiest way to get a lower grade is to turn in your assignments late. If you know that something is coming up (business/vacation travel, expected very busy week at work, medical, expected baby) please let me know and I'm happy to work with you.</p>
<p><em><em>HOWEVER</em></em>, telling me a few days before an assignment is due that "work was very busy" is not acceptable and will not result in an extension. (If an emergency occurs, please let me know as soon as possible)</p>
<p><strong>General guidelines for grade ranges</strong>. These are <em>general guidelines</em>, not absolute descriptions of a grading level. Your overall grade on an assignment depends on the overall quality and functionality of your submission.</p>
<p><strong>Again, these are <em>general</em> guidelines. You can get lower grades for very significant problems in your submissions and very late submissions</strong></p>
<table>
<thead><th>Letter Grade</th><th>General Guidelines</th></thead>
<tr><td>A</td><td>On time, working, and good design</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>	Not quite working, or<br/>
Bad design/bad style, or<br/>
One day late (but would have otherwise been an "A")</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>	Little apparent effort, or<br/>
Will not compile, or<br/>
Will not execute properly, or<br/>
Very bad design, or <br/>
One day late (but would have been an "B"), or<br/>
    					Two days late (but would have been an "A")</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>	Plagiarism<br/>
Three or more days late<br/>
No apparent effort<br/>
Not turned in</td></tr>
</table>
<p>I grade on the following aspects of your submissions. Note that there is no specific percentage allocation for each of these concepts.</p>
<table>
<thead><th>Aspect</th><th>What I look for</th></thead>
<tr><td>Design</td>
<td>Does the design use the patterns discussed in class properly?<br/> 
Does the design use abstraction effectively?<br/>
Does the design fit the problem? <br/>
Is the program designed with a maintenance programmer in mind?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Function</td>
<td>Does it work properly?<br/> 
Is all required function present?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Style and Coding Conventions</td>
<td>Is the code readable? <br/>
Can I easily figure out what it's doing just by reading the code?<br/>
Does the code follow the required coding conventions?<br/>
<br/>
Note: Not following the required coding conventions, even once in a submission, maximizes your assignment grade at A-
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Timeliness</td>
<td>Was the assignment submitted on time?
<ul>             
<li>one day late = one letter grade deduction</li>
<li>two days late = two letter grade deduction</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
<h1>Coding Conventions</h1>
<p>All assignments must observe the following coding conventions. </p>
<p><em><strong>Why? I read your code.</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes your code doesn't work correctly (sometimes spectacularly so...). Before I decide on the grade to give you, I carefully read the code to try to figure out why it didn't work. If the reason is a small, subtle thing, I'll often give more credit (rather than simply saying "doesn't work; you get a C") I often have to do this for several assignments. If the code is readable, using meaning variable, method and class names, I can often find the problems more quickly.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that I have many submissions to review each time, and usually 20% or more have some big issues. This also helps a good bit when some of you are having trouble before submitting and ask for help. If I can read the code, I can figure out what's going on and respond that much more quickly. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Indentation must be consistent. Use either spaces or tabs, but not both!</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>All type names must follow Upper-Camel Case</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ShoppingCart</li>
      <li>ObjectDrawingApplet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All variable and method names must follow Lower-Camel Case</p>
    <ul>
      <li>drawObject()</li>
      <li>numberOfObjectsOnScreen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type, variable and method names shall be a series of full words, not abbreviations or single letters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Standard acronyms are acceptable (such as url), but names like "c" are generally not acceptable. If you aren't sure whether a name is acceptable, feel free to ask me, but remember the rule of thumb: it should sound exactly like what it's being used for.</li>
      <li>Exceptions (based on common, understood usage):</li>
      <li>integer counters in loops can be named i, j, k</li>
      <li>the "current number" for walking through an array or counting items can be n</li>
      <li>e for an exception in a catch block</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>All classes and interfaces must be contained in a Java package</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>All Java package names must be completely lower-case and start with lastname.firstname.hw# where the # is the homework number. For example, I might have a project named stanchfield.scott.hw4 (with the same Android package name) that contains Java packages stanchfield.scott.hw4 stanchfield.scott.hw4.model stanchfield.scott.hw4.database</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>All projects must be named HW1, HW2, HW3 and so forth</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>All submission zip files must be named lastname.firstname.HW1.zip, lastname.firstname.HW2.zip, etc </p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Help &amp; Support</h1>
<p>Students should refer to Help &amp; Support on the left menu of the course site for a listing of all the student services and support available to them.</p>
<h1>Using Open Source Content and My Code Examples</h1>
<p>Note that you may copy small sections of code and other content you find online <strong>if and only if</strong> you attribute it and the code is freely copyable with a license that says it's ok to copy. Place a comment above the copied section stating where you found it and the license that applies.</p>
<p>You may copy code from my class examples as well. Once again, attribute it. Assume that any code I do not explicitly mark is licensed for your use only in this class and for not other purpose. You may not post or distribute any of my code for anyone else's use or for any purpose other than your work for this class.</p>
<p>Note that your submissions must be <em>substantially</em> your own work. If your submission is 90% my example code, with a few names and drawables changed, your grade will be significantly lowered. Note that some assignments will use quite a bit of sample code from class, but you will need to merge several examples and change them a good bit just to meet requirements.</p>
<h1>Your Work in this Class</h1>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. I HAVE HAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GRADES BECAUSE OF ISSUES MANY TIMES IN THE PAST</strong></p>
<p>Please be sure to read the <strong>Academic Misconduct Policy</strong> below.</p>
<p>Collaborations and discussions between students are key ingredients to success in a graduate course. You are encouraged to discuss the course <em>material</em> with each other as you sort through concepts that may be difficult to comprehend or controversial. However, the line between collaboration and cheating needs to be carefully delineated. Whenever you turn in work with your name on it to be evaluated, graded and included in your record it must represent an <em>individual</em> effort by you alone.</p>
<p>If you include direct quotes or code from any source in your discussions or project submissions, you must provide attribution. Note that you are only allowed to include code when the license for that code is explicitly stated (such as what I mention above for course code samples) and that license is open source.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: I have had issues with plagiarism during several terms. I am very good at catching this! Work that you submit as your own must actually be substantially your own. Any code that you borrow must be attributed.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let me repeat: You cannot discuss what your code or project structure will look like. It's ok to discuss the concepts and code I have demonstrated, but you cannot discuss how to apply those concepts to the homework assignments.</p>
<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p><strong>Academic Misconduct Policy</strong></p>
<p>All students are required to read, know, and comply with the Johns Hopkins University Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) / Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Procedures for Handling Allegations of Misconduct by Full-Time and Part-Time Graduate Students available at: <a href='https://ep.jhu.edu/wseacademicmisconductpolicy' target='_blank'>https://ep.jhu.edu/wseacademicmisconductpolicy</a></p>
<p>This policy prohibits academic misconduct, including but not limited to the following: cheating or facilitating cheating; plagiarism; reuse of assignments; unauthorized collaboration; alteration of graded assignments; and unfair competition. You may request a paper copy of this policy at this by contacting</p>
